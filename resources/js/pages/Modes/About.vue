          <h2>About the site:</h2>
          <p>This is a Woordle inspired puzzle game, but with characters from the mobile game Blue Archive.</p>
          <p>This project is still a work in progress. Bugs and unexpected issues may occur.</p>
          <p>I have several features planned, but they may or may not be implemented depending
            on available time and interest.</p>
